# Traffic Management AI Framework

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-driven framework for traffic management, focusing on optimizing urban traffic flow for autonomous vehicle ecosystems. It integrates C++ for traffic simulation, TensorFlow for machine learning algorithms, OpenCV for real-time image processing, and Unreal Engine for high-fidelity visualization.

## Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- Python (version 3.x)
- TensorFlow (version 2.x)
- OpenCV (version 4.x)
- Unreal Engine (version 4.x)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-management-ai.git
   cd traffic-management-ai
